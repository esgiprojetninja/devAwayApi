Feature: Basic API Routes
  In order to interact with my application from the front end
  As a front end developer with no knowledge of API wizardry
  I need to have an awesomely clear API to work with

  Scenario: GET "/api/foo"
    When I send a GET request to "/api/foo"
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the JSON response should have a "message" containing "Hello World"
